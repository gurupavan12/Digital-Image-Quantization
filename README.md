# Digital-Image-Quantization
Project-1 as part of EE455 - Digital Image Processing 1. This project was the first introduction to DIP and Digital Image Quantization project. The tasks that were to be done are included in the file p1.pdf. 
This project required us to submit the files in MATLAB by performing Image processing methods without the use of inbuilt MATLAB function for DIP. Please find the report ReportProject1_PavanGurudath.pdf that contains the entire report for this project.
